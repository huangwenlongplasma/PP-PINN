PP-PINN
Solving partial differential equations based on preconditioning-pretraining physics informed neural network Abstract. Physics informed neural network (PINN) is a deep learning based framework which has been widely used to solve spatial-temporal partial differential equations (PDE) in various fields. Recently, numerical experiments show that the vanilla-PINN meets failures when it is used to solve PDEs with high frequency solution or strong nonlinearity. To improve the performance of PINN, a new strategy named as preconditioning-pretraining physics informed neural network (PP-PINN) is proposed in this work. First, the original task is transformed to a new system with low frequency and weak nonlinearity in a long time scale. Then, we solve the transformed PDEs via the pretraining approach. Furthermore, a new constraint named as “fixed point” is also introduced, which is benefit for the cases with extremely high frequency or strong nonlinearity. To illustrate the performance of our method, three different equations are predicted via the new developed strategy, which show better accuracy and computation cost than previous works. The effectiveness and interpretability of our PP-PINN is also discussed.
